# Mission-to-Mars
Challenge 10 for UT Bootcamp - Web scraping, HTML, and CSS

## Deliverable 1:
The Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb works and runs as instructed.

## Deliverables 2:
Incomplete. I updated the app.py, scraping.py, and index.html files to the best of my ability.  I was unable to get these three to run together and produce the webpage. (The server is timing out when I run app.py and it appears to be an error with my html or MongoDB.) I have tried to debug via MongoDB adjustments, adjustments to my app.py and other files, and I have not had any luck. I have spent a few hours on Stack Overflow and reading other documentation and trying to fix it. I have to move on to other things as much as I hate not finishing this assignment. Please assign my grade accordingly.  Thank you.
